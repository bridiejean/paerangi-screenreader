      <h1>What is COVID-19?</h1>
      <h2>People with COVID-19 may:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Have a cough.</li>
        <li>Have a fever – this is when you get really hot.</li>
        <li>Find it hard to breathe.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It is important to know that people who get a cold or flu may also have
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people with COVID-19 may not get sick. But they can still pass the
        virus to another person.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can take up to 14 days from the time a person has been around someone
        with COVID-19 to when they get sick.
      </p>
      <h2>
        When a person has COVID-19 they can spread droplets onto things or
        people around them when they:
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Cough.</li>
        <li>Sneeze.</li>
        <li>Talk.</li>
        <li>Touch other people like shaking hands.</li>
        <li>Touch surfaces or objects that someone else then touches.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Droplets are very small bits of liquid that come out of a person’s nose
        or mouth.
      </p>
      <p>The droplets could have the COVID-19 virus in them.</p>
      <p>Surfaces and objects are things like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Tables.</li>
        <li>Kitchen benches.</li>
        <li>Door handles.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>
        There are some important things that everyone can do to stop the spread
        of COVID-19.
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Stay away from people who are unwell with a cold or flu.</li>
        <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
        <li>
          Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
        </li>
        <li>Throw away any tissues that you use.</li>
        <li>Cough or sneeze into your elbow if you have no tissues.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Make sure you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20
        seconds:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>After coughing or sneezing.</li>
        <li>After blowing your nose.</li>
        <li>Before eating or touching food.</li>
        <li>After using the toilet.</li>
        <li>After helping children wipe their noses.</li>
        <li>After caring for sick people.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If there is no water or soap you can use hand sanitiser.</p>
      <h2>Another important thing you can do is try not to touch your:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Eyes.</li>
        <li>Nose.</li>
        <li>Mouth.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
